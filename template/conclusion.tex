\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

We began with the goal of developing a program that could estimate a
function using Symbolic Regression analysis for two different
datasets. We used standard genetic programming practices to evolve
random functions into reasonable estimates of a function for each
dataset. The most notable aspects of our program are: the initial
population size of 1000, reproduction rate of 10\%, a point
mutation rate of 40\% in 10\% of each population, and random crossing
over between individuals selected by tournament selection.\\

Over all the independent runs on the dataset from Generator 1, we only
converged on a function with non-existant error for the test set and
training set once. However, our algorithm never found a function for
the three variable dataset with an absolute error less than 400
million. Given our results, we
believe our program is only capable of estimating single variable
functions with any reliable accuracy. \\

In future experiments, a larger generation size and a greater number of generations should be used to evolve a solution. Additionally, a secondary selection criterion similar to the order of nonlinearity selection proposed by Vladislavleva et al would be beneficial for more accurate estimations, especially for multivariable functions \cite{Vladislavleva:2009:ONC:1650356.1650365}.
